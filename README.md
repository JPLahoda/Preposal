# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# I am going to do either a choice-based game that was shown today in class (11/2) or I'm going to go onto one of the recommended websites like Pygame and do stuff with that.
# I like video games so I would prefer to make something that has to do with HP like Dungeons and Dragons.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

# N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# No
