## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# My Fortune Cookie

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# The game I'm going to make is a fortune cookie program. I do not expect to have a finished product by the time I submit it, because there are many features that would take a lot of time to implement to make it much more impressive.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# I have no experience with programming other than in this class, so this program's code might not impress you. I hope the idea is
# mainly what is considered when judging it. I plan to have a game that will draw from a dictionary of fortunes, picked by a random number
# generator. I want to make it so a fortune can not be selected twice. Also, two fortunes may be picked per day. I'm not sure if that 
# feature will be easy to implement. I also want to have different peaceful Chinese-style background themes to be generated every time the software
# is launched, since fortune cookies are Chinese. Random, serene/charming unlicensed music would also play in the background. There would be fixed sound effects.
# I would hope that with much more development, this program could aesthetically and emotionally please its audience through art and good fortunes.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable (N/A)

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable (N/A)

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# The program would select a random backround image, song to play, have a functioning title screen, select a random fortune from a list (then delete that fortune off of the list), and make the user feel hopeful through fortune-telling.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# It would do all of the above, but it would also delete fortunes from being selected twice at any point.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# It would do all of the above, but it would also have a limit on how many fortunes may be selected per day (a limit of two).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# I will need to research different platforms that may be used to make this game. I might need to figure out how to animate a cookie opening and find animated buttons to make the game look less primal. 
# I should start looking at different softwares to use in order to make this. Renpy, Pygame, and Unity are all viable resources. I am very interested in using Unity to make this game. It would be interesting if it were 3D and 1st or 3rd person.
